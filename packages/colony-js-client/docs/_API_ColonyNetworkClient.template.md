The `ColonyNetworkClient` is a standard interface for interactions with functions and events described in `IColonyNetwork.sol`.

These interactions are generally concerned with the colony network as a whole, rather than at the colony level. This includes operations like getting a count of all colonies on the network, querying for information about a parent skillId, or deposits/withdrawals of staked CLNY for use in the reputation system.

You can learn more about the solidity implementation from the [Colony Network Docs](/colonynetwork/docs-colony).

For interactions within a particular colony, see the [ColonyClient API](/colonyjs/api-colonyclient/).

## Create an instance

You can create an instance of `ColonyNetworkClient` by providing an [adapter](/colonyjs/docs-adapters):

```js

const networkClient = new ColonyNetworkClient({ adapter });

await networkClient.init();

```
