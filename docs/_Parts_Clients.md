Clients are aggregations of all the interactions possible with the [colonyNetwork](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork) smart contracts that can be used to easily integrate Colony into your JavaScript application or service. Each client is a subclass of the `ContractClient` superclass (see [ContractClient](/colonyjs/api-contractclient) for more information).

## Initializing Clients


colonyJS makes it simple to create a new instance of a `ContractClient` subclass. Let's take a look at examples for each subclass.

### ColonyNetworkClient

You can create an instance of `ColonyNetworkClient` by providing an [adapter](/colonyjs/docs-adapters):

```js

const networkClient = new ColonyNetworkClient({ adapter });

await networkClient.init();

```

### ColonyClient

The easiest way to initialize the `ColonyClient` is to ask the `ColonyNetworkClient` for a new instance:

```js

const colonyClient = await networkClient.getColonyClient(colonyId);

```

You _could_ also create an instance of `ColonyClient` by providing an [adapter](/colonyjs/docs-adapters) and a query:

```js

const colonyClient = new ColonyClient({ adapter, query });

await colonyClient.init();

```

### MetaColonyClient

The easiest way to initialize the `MetaColonyClient` is to ask the `ColonyNetworkClient` for a new instance:

```js

const metaColonyClient = await networkClient.getMetaColonyClient();

```

You _could_ create an instance of `MetaColonyClient` by providing an [adapter](/colonyjs/docs-adapters) and a query:

```js

const metaColonyClient = new MetaColonyClient({ adapter, query });

await metaColonyClient.init();

```

### TokenClient

The `TokenClient` is initialized for you when you ask the `ColonyNetworkClient` for a new instance of `ColonyClient`:

```js

const tokenClient = colonyClient.token;

```

You _could_ create an instance of `TokenClient` by providing an [adapter](/colonyjs/docs-adapters) and a query:

```js

const tokenClient = new TokenClient({ adapter, query });

await tokenClient.init();

```
