The `ContractMethodMultisigSender` (short `MutlisigSender`) class is a part of the `ContractClient` to create Multisignature transactions. They are usually created for a `ContractClient` class on its initialization (e.g. the [ColonyClient](/colonyjs/api-colonyclient)) and are associated with a method on the smart contract which requires more than one signature to be executed.

For more info see the [Multisignature](/colonyjs/docs-multisignature/) docs. Please also check out the [MultisigOperation](/colonyjs/api-multisigoperation/) docs for the signature handling API.

## Instance methods

### `startOperation(inputValues)`

Given named input values, it will generate the `MultisigOperation` needed to gather all signatures to send off this transaction.

**Arguments**

**`inputValues`** `{ [string]: any }` - Any key value pair of contract input parameters

**Returns**

`Promise<MultisigOperation>` - Promise that resolves to a `MultisigOperation` instance.

### `restoreOperation(json)`

Given a serialized operation object as a valid json string, it restores the given operation.

**Arguments**

**`json`** `string` - A serialized operation created via a MultisigOperation instance's .toJSON() method

**Returns**

`Promise<MultisigOperation>` - Promise that resolves to a `MultisigOperation` instance.
