section: API
order: 3
---

The `TokenClient` is a standard interface for interactions with functions and events described in `Token.sol`.

Upon creation, new colonies can either create or import existing token contracts. These contracts are expected to conform to the ERC20 or ERC20Extended token standard interface, the latter allowing for `mint` and `burn` functions. The token client is intended to help keep interactions with a colony's token straightforward.

Most functions are fairly self-explanatory and mirror their on-chain counterparts, but in some cases the function will return values passed from event data, rather than simple boolean expressions (which are returned from the contract on-chain).

==TOC==

## Create an instance

The `TokenClient` is initialized for you when you ask the `ColonyNetworkClient` for a new instance of `ColonyClient`:

```js

const tokenClient = colonyClient.token;

```

You _could_ create an instance of `TokenClient` by providing an [adapter](/colonyjs/docs-adapters) and a query:

```js

const tokenClient = new TokenClient({ adapter, query });

await tokenClient.init();

```

  
## Callers

**All callers return promises which resolve to an object containing the given return values.** For a reference please check [here](/colonyjs/docs-contractclient/#callers).

### `getAllowance.call({ sourceAddress, user })`

**Arguments**

|Argument|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|sourceAddress|Address|The address that approved the allowance (the token `owner`).|
|user|Address|The address that was approved for the allowance (the token `spender`).|

**Returns**

A promise which resolves to an object containing the following properties:

|Return value|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|amount|BigNumber|The amount of tokens that were approved (the amount `allowed`).|

### `getBalanceOf.call({ sourceAddress })`

Get the the token balance of an address.

**Arguments**

|Argument|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|

**Returns**

A promise which resolves to an object containing the following properties:

|Return value|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|amount|BigNumber|The balance of tokens for the address.|

### `getTokenInfo.call()`

Get information about the token.


**Returns**

A promise which resolves to an object containing the following properties:

|Return value|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|name|string|The name of the token.|
|symbol|string|The symbol of the token.|
|decimals|number|The number of decimals.|

## Senders

**All senders return an instance of a `ContractResponse`.** Every `send()` method takes an `options` object as the second argument. For a reference please check [here](/colonyjs/docs-contractclient/#senders).
### `approve.send({ user, amount }, options)`

Approve a token allowance. This function can only be called by the token `owner`. The allowance is the amount of tokens that the `spender` is authorized to transfer using the `transferFrom` function.

**Arguments**

|Argument|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|user|Address|The address that will be approved for the allowance (the token `spender`).|

**Returns**

An instance of a `ContractResponse` which will eventually receive the following event data:

|Event data|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|owner|Address|The address that approved the allowance (the token `owner`).|
|spender|Address|The address that was approved for the allowance (the token `spender`).|
|value|BigNumber|The amount of tokens that were approved (the amount `allowed`).|
|Approval|object|Contains the data defined in [Approval](#eventsapprovaladdlistener-owner-spender-value-------)|

### `burn.send({ user, amount }, options)`

Burn tokens. This is an `ERC20Extended` function that can only be called by the token `owner`. When a colony contract address is assigned as the token `owner`, this function can only be called by the user assigned the `FOUNDER` authority role.

**Arguments**

|Argument|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|user|Address|The address from which to burn tokens.|
|amount|BigNumber|The amount of tokens that will be burned.|

**Returns**

An instance of a `ContractResponse` which will eventually receive the following event data:

|address|Address|The address from which the tokens were burned.|
|amount|BigNumber|The amount of tokens that were burned.|
|Burn|object|Contains the data defined in [Burn](#eventsburnaddlistener-address-amount-------)|

### `mint.send({ user, amount }, options)`

Mint new tokens. This is an `ERC20Extended` function that can only be called by the token `owner`. When a colony contract address is assigned as the token `owner`, this function can only be called by the user assigned the `FOUNDER` authority role.

**Arguments**

|Argument|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|user|Address|The address to send the minted tokens to|
|amount|BigNumber|The amount of tokens that will be minted.|

**Returns**

An instance of a `ContractResponse` which will eventually receive the following event data:

|address|Address|The address to which the minted tokens were sent.|
|amount|BigNumber|The amount of tokens that were minted.|
|Mint|object|Contains the data defined in [Mint](#eventsmintaddlistener-address-amount-------)|
