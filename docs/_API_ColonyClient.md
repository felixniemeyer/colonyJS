title: ColonyClient
section: API
order: 1
---

The `ColonyClient` class is a standard interface for interactions with the on-chain functions and events described in `IColony.sol`

These interactions are generally concerned with functions and events internal to a colony, such as creating a task, assigning a work rating, or moving funds between pots.

For functions and events that concern the colonyNetwork as a whole, refer to the [ColonyNetworkClient API](/colonyjs/api-colonynetworkclient/).

==TOC==

## Create an instance

The easiest way to initialize the `ColonyClient` is to ask the `ColonyNetworkClient` for a new instance:

```js

const colonyClient = await networkClient.getColonyClient(colonyId);

```

You _could_ also create an instance of `ColonyClient` by providing an [adapter](/colonyjs/docs-adapters) and a query:

```js

const colonyClient = new ColonyClient({ adapter, query });

await colonyClient.init();

```

  
## Callers

**All callers return promises which resolve to an object containing the given return values.** For a reference please check [here](/colonyjs/docs-contractclient/#callers).
