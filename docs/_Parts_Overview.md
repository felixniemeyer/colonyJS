[colonyJS](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyJS) is a library to help developers build with Colony. Using the colonyJS library, you can build applications and services that query and interact with the [colonyNetwork](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork) smart contracts through a simple and standard JavaScript interface.

colonyJS is split into a few components to allow for flexibility in development:

* [Loaders](/colonyjs/docs-loaders) provide a simple way to get the address and ABI of a deployed contract, in a certain version, at a particular location. For example, loaders can pull data from contracts deployed to public networks such as `rinkeby` or `mainnet` using the Etherscan API or from contracts deployed locally that are being served with [TrufflePig](https://github.com/JoinColony/trufflepig).

* [Adapters](/colonyjs/docs-adapters) represent the colonyJS solution for the many different ways to access the Ethereum blockchain provided by various JavaScript libraries. Adapters provide a wrapper for such libraries that enforces a standard and predictable API for use with the colonyNetwork smart contracts.

* [Clients](/colonyjs/docs-clients) are aggregations of all the interactions possible with the colonyNetwork smart contracts that can be used to easily integrate Colony into your JavaScript application or service. Currently there are four clients, each corresponding with a colonyNetwork smart contract: `ColonyNetworkClient`, `ColonyClient`, `MetaColonyClient` and `TokenClient`.
